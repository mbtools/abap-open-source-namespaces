# ABAP Open Source Namespaces

## About this project

In response to the suggestions and feedback from our community, SAP made available dedicated [ABAP Open Source Namespaces](https://me.sap.com/namespaces/opensource). The list of already existing namespaces is [available in the Development Namespace Application](https://me.sap.com/namespaces/opensource). In addition, we list them here, including the development and repair keys for DEMOSYSTEM installations like the [ABAP Cloud Developer Trial](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/abap-cloud-developer-trial-2022-available-now/ba-p/13598069). If you would like to create an own namespace for an open source project, please reach out to the [SAP Open Source Program Office via e-mail](mailto:ospo@sap.com). Weâ€™ll be happy to get your project onboarded.
If you have any questions or feedback regarding ABAP Open Source Namespaces, feel free to post a issue here or [reach out to us via e-mail](mailto:ospo@sap.com).

## Requirements and Setup

There are no specific requirements for the request of a new ABAP Open Source Namespace. As outlined [in the official documentation](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/support/en_us/library/ssp/my-support/keys/new-request-namespace.pdf), please [reach out to the SAP Open Source Program Office via e-mail](mailto:ospo@sap.com) and mention a few details about your project to get the namespace approved and created.

## Existing ABAP Open Source Namespaces

**Note:** The development keys listed below are exclusively for ABAP Cloud Developer Trial systems (or any others with 'DEMOSYSTEM' as installation ID). For all other systems, please use the [Development Namespace Application](https://me.sap.com/namespaces/opensource). The given repair keys should work on any system.

## Automated Import to ABAP Cloud Developer Trial

You can import the namespaces including development and repair keys into your A4H System using [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit).

As a prerequisite, you needs to implement the following [abapGit exit](https://docs.abapgit.org/user-guide/reference/exits.html#change-supported-data-objects) to allow write access to the SAP Namespace tables for systems with `DEMOSYSTEM` license number.


```abap
METHOD zif_abapgit_user_exit~change_supported_data_objects.

  DATA lv_license_num TYPE c LENGTH 10.
  DATA ls_object LIKE LINE OF ct_objects.

  CALL FUNCTION 'SLIC_GET_LICENCE_NUMBER'
    IMPORTING
      license_number = lv_license_num.

  IF lv_license_num = 'DEMOSYSTEM'.
    ls_object-type = 'TABU'.
    ls_object-name = 'TRNSPACE*'.
    INSERT ls_object INTO TABLE ct_objects.
  ENDIF.

ENDMETHOD.
```

Once the exit is active, start abapGit, create an [Online Repository](https://docs.abapgit.org/user-guide/projects/online/install.html) for `https://github.com/SAP/abap-open-source-namespaces` (use any new local package), and pull the namespace data into your system.
